# SimpleGamepad
A gamepad code for Arduino Leonardo/Pro Micro based on ArduinoJoystickLibrary<br/>
Using a modified Joystick.h<br/>
With 10 buttons and 1 axis<br/>

Grab ArduinoJoystickLibrary here: https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary/ <br>
Keep in mind that I'm using an older version(1.0) of ArduinoJoystickLibrary, that means you'll need to put xaxis and buttons into public in Joystick_ class. I put an example modified Joystick.h into the folder too, so that you can know what's the difference
